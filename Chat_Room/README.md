## User Manual
</div>

####  Requirements
###### Python Version
The game requires `Python 3` or higher to run. You can check your  version by running below command:
```bash
$ python -version
```
###### Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Getting Started
###### To run a program, you need to:
- Clone this repository
 ```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```
###### If you're using Docker:
This section will guide you through the steps to build and run a Docker container for the Chatroom application using the provided Dockerfile.

1. Build the Docker Image or pull it from the DockerHub:

###### DockerHub
Use the following command to pull the image from DockerHub:

```bash
$ docker pull weronikastepien/chat-room
```

And to run the container:

```bash
$ docker run -p 5000:5000 chat-room:web-app
```
Open your browser and go to:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000 "Chatroom application")

###### Docker

If you prefer build the Docker image from the Dockerfile use this command instead:
```bash
$ docker build -t chatroom-app .
```
-  `-t chatroom-app` assigns a name/tag to your Docker image. You can replace `chatroom-app` with your preferred name.
- `.` specifies that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

2. Run the Docker Container
   Once the image is built, you can create and run a container from that image using the command below:
```bash
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name chatroom-app-container chatroom-app
```
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 5000:5000` maps port `5000` on your local machine to port `5000` on the container.
- `--name chatroom-app-container` assigns a custom name to the running container.
- `chatroom-app` is the name of the image created earlier.

3. Open your browser and go to:
   [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000 "Chatroom application")

###### If you're using the executable file:
- Navigate to the repository's `releases` folder where the executable file is located.
- Double-click the executable file (`Chat.jar`) to launch the game.
- If the executable does not open via double-click, run the following command from the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
$  python Chat.jar
```

###### If you're running from Source Code
- Start the Flask-based chat room app locally:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
- Access the application via your web browser at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

#### Customization
###### Configuring Flask Settings
You can modify the Flask applicationâ€™s behavior by changing settings in the main.py file or adding environment variables. By default, the app runs in production mode. To enable debug mode, set the FLASK_ENV variable to development:

**Steps to make the change:**
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development  # Linux/macOS
set FLASK_ENV=development  # Windows
```

###### Change Listening Port
The default port is 5000. To change this, open main.py and modify the main.run() line:
```python
main.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)  # Example for changing to port 8080
```
