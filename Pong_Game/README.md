## Overview
The minimalistic Pong game implemented in Python using Pygame. It features smooth gameplay, paddle and ball mechanics plus customizable win conditions, all running at a smooth 60 FPS.


------------



## Key Features
##### Paddle Movement Control
###### Players control paddles using the `W` and `S` keys for the left paddle and the arrow keys for the right paddle.
##### Ball Physics
###### The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the paddles and the walls with realistic velocity changes based on the point of impact.
##### Collision Detection
###### Accurate collision detection ensures the ball bounces off paddles and the screen boundaries appropriately.
##### Real-Time Scorekeeping</center>
###### Tracks and displays the score for both players, showing each playerâ€™s progress during the match.
##### Winning Condition
###### The first player to reach the winning score is declared the victor, and a winning message is displayed on the screen.

## User Manual
</div>

####  Requirements
###### Python Version
The game requires `Python 3` or higher to run. You can check your  version by running below command:
```bash
$ python -version
```
###### Pygame library
If you are running the game from source code, make sure `Pygame` is installed and configured. You can check if it is installed by running the following commands in the terminal:
- Method 1 - Checking Installed Packages (Pip)
```bash
# Depending on your system you can either use
$ pip list | grep pygame
# Or
$ pip3 list | grep pygame
```
If `Pygame` is installed, it will appear in the list with its version number.

-  Method 2 - Using the Command Line
```bash
# Depending on your system you can either use
$ python -m pygame --version
# Or
$ python3 -m pygame --version
```
If `Pygame` is installed, this will print the version number of it. If not, you'll see an error saying that the module was not found.

- Method 3 - Using the Python Interpreter
1. Enter the Python interactive shell by typing:
```bash
$ python
```
or, depending on your system:
```bash
$ python3
```
2. Once you're inside the Python shell, type:
```python
$ import pygame
```
3. If `Pygame` is installed, you will not see any output or errors. If it is not installed, you will see an error like this:
```vbnet
$ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'
```
4. To exit the Python shell, type:
```python
$ exit()
```

#### Getting Started
###### To run a program, you need to:
- Clone this repository
 ```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```
###### If you're using the executable file:
- Navigate to the repository's `releases` folder where the executable file is located.
- Double-click the executable file (`Pong.jar`) to launch the game.
- If the executable does not open via double-click, run the following command from the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
$  python Pong.jar
```
###### If you're running from Source Code
- Open the project in your preferred  `IDE` (e.g.,PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Run the `solution.py` class located in the `venv` package to launch the game.

#### Customization
###### Winning Score
The default winning score is set to `2`, but you can change this to make the game longer or shorter.

**Steps to make the change:**
1. Open `solution.py`.
2. Look for the `WINNING_SCORE` variable at the top of the file:
```python
$ WINNING_SCORE = 2
```
3. Change the value to your desired winning score.

###### Key Bindings
You can customize the keys used to control the paddles by modifying the key events in the `handle_paddle_movement` function.
**Steps to make the change:**
- In the `handle_paddle_movement` function, locate the key bindings for player controls:
```python
$ if keys[pygame.K_w]:
    left_paddle.move(up=True)
$ if keys[pygame.K_s]:
    left_paddle.move(up=False)
```
- Change the `pygame.K_w` and `pygame.K_s` to other keys (e.g., `pygame.K_a`, `pygame.K_z`) if you want different controls for the left paddle.
- Similarly, adjust the key bindings for the right paddle (`pygame.K_UP`, `pygame.K_DOWN`) to new keys as needed.
