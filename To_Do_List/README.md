## User Manual

####  Requirements
###### Python Version
The game requires `Python 3` or higher to run. You can check your  version by running below command:
```bash
$ python -version
```
###### SQLite
The To-Do List app comes with `SQLite` configured by default. It is a lightweight, serverless database, perfect for small-scale applications and development environments. No additional setup is required.

The default configuration for `SQLite` can be found in `settings.py`:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```
Run migrations to create the necessary database tables.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
###### Dependencies
Install the required `Python` packages:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Getting Started
###### To run a program, you need to:
- Clone this repository
 ```bash
$ git clone <repository_url>
```

###### If you're using the executable file:
- Navigate to the repository's `releases` folder where the executable file is located.
- Double-click the executable file (`todo.jar`) to launch the game.
- If the executable does not open via double-click, run the following command from the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
$  python todo.jar
```

###### If you're running from Source Code
- Run the application:
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
- Access the application via your web browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

#### Customization
###### The task model
The task model can be extended to include additional fields or functionality:

**Steps to make the change:**
1. Open the `models.py` file in the `todo` directory.
2. Add new fields like priority, due date, or category:
```python
class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    complete = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    priority = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='Medium')  # New field
    due_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)  # New field
```
3. Run the following commands to apply the changes:
```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

###### Database
The app uses `SQLite` by default, but you can change the database backend (e.g., `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL`):

**Steps to make the change:**
1. In `settings.py`, modify the `DATABASES` section:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'todo_db',
        'USER': 'yourusername',
        'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
2. Ensure you install the necessary database driver, e.g., `psycopg2` for `PostgreSQL`:
```bash
$ pip install psycopg2
```
